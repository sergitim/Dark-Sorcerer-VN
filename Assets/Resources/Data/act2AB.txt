No. No, he couldn't. He wasn't ready to make such a sacrifice.
Eryndor snarled and raised his staff, preparing to unleash a devastating spell.
Arin didn't even have time to think before the attack hit him square in the chest.
A massive force slammed into Arin, sending him flying backward. He tumbled across the floor, struggling to catch his breath.
Eryndor stood over him, grinning cruelly.
Eryndor: "So, boy. Have you learned your lesson?"
Arin clutched at his chest, trying to still the pain.
Arin: "Never underestimate your enemy"
He gasped out, wheezing.
Eryndor laughed.
Eryndor: "You're right, boy. You never should."
He raised his staff once more, and darkness descended upon them both.
Chapter 9 - The Final Battle
Eryndor had taken possession of the Orb of Chaos, using it to fuel his spells.
With its power, he became almost invincible. 
He summoned demons by the dozen and hurled bolts of lightning at Arin.
Despite his best efforts, Arin couldn't fight back against the relentless assault.
He raised his shield, like Eldric taught him. But even with his shield, all he could do was buy time.
Then, just when things seemed hopeless, a new figure stepped onto the chamber. It was Eldric.
Arin: "Eldric! You're back!"
Eldric: "The Black Guard didn't put as much as a fight as I expected. But I couldn't leave you alone in here."
Eryndor scowled, turning to face the Wizard.
Eryndor: "Ah, so the master shows himself! But you're too late! The boy has already failed. The Orb of Chaos won't be taken by the likes of you."
Eldric didn't waver.
Eldric: "I know better than to believe that. You may have the orb, but Arin isn't defeated yet. Not while there is hope."
Arin rallied his strength, standing up straighter. Eldric was right.
Perhaps there was never any need for him to make the ultimate sacrifice after all. Maybe he could find another way to win this battle.
Eryndor: "Hope? Ha! There's no hope left for you two. Prepare to meet your end."
Arin nodded resolutely. Time to prove Eryndor wrong once and for all.
With a flick of his wrist, Arin sent chunk of rock hurtling towards Eryndor. It struck him square in the chest, and he staggered backward.
Eryndor roared in anger and pointed his staff at Arin. Black fire erupted from the tip, engulfing him in flames.
Arin fell to his knees, gasping for air.
His clothes were smoldering, and he could feel his skin blistering beneath them.
Eryndor advanced on him, laughter bubbling up from deep within him.
Eryndor: "This is the end of you, boy. Your life... For my power."
Arin closed his eyes, steeling himself for the final blow.
But it never came.
Instead, a loud crash echoed through the chamber, followed by the sound of breaking glass.
It had been caused by a sudden spell from Eldric, who had tried to create a distraction.
Eryndor turned to see what had happened, and in that moment, Arin made his move.
He lunged forward, grabbing the Orb of Chaos and throwing it as hard as he could at Eryndor's head.
It shattered on impact, showering the dark sorcerer in a spray of glittering fragments.
Eryndor screamed in agony as the magic that was swirling inside the orb began to consume him.
Arin watched in horror as Eryndor's body contorted and twisted, until finally, he collapsed to the ground. Dead.
Arin let out a sigh of relief. He had won.
The spell holding the Black Guard's stronghold broke, and the fortress began falling apart.
The soldiers looked around in confusion, not knowing what to do without their leader.
Meanwhile, Eldric walked over to where Arin was standing. He placed a hand on his shoulder.
Eldric: "Well done, boy. You've saved the world."
Arin smiled weakly. "Thanks, Eldric," he said. "It feels good to know that I did something important."
Eldric: "You did far more than 'something'. You defeated one of the most powerful dark sorcerers to ever walk this land. And you did it all on your own."
Arin: "I couldn't have done it without you, Eldric. Thank you for believing in me."
Eldric laughed. "Believe in yourself, Arin. That's all any of us can really do."
Eldric clapped him on the back, then turned and headed for the door.
Eldric: "Come on. Let's go home."
Arin followed Eldric out of the ruined fortress, feeling a sense of accomplishment he had never felt before.
Despite everything that had happened, he knew now that everything would be fine.
And with Eldric by his side, there was nothing he couldn't achieve.
The End
