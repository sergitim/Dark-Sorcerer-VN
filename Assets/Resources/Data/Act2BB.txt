Arin: "...I'm sorry, Irina. It's just too dangerous. I can't let you come with me."
Tears filled her eyes as she nodded sadly. She knew that Arin was right, but she didn't want him to go alone either.
Irina: "Got it... I'll stay here and... protect mom and dad while you're gone. But you have to come back soon, okay? Promise me you'll be back?"
Arin: "Alright, Irina. I promise."
As he rode on his horse, accompanied by Sabel and a few others, Irina watched silently from afar, worrying for her big brother's safety.
The army moved forward slowly; there were many soldiers in the group, as well as horses that needed to rest often. The further they got from Ralz village, the more danger lurked around every corner.
Arin could feel his heart pounding faster and sweat pouring down his forehead.
In moments like these, Irina's optimism would never fail to cheer him up. Part of him regretted leaving her behind. But it was for the best. She would be safer with her parents.
Sabel rode next to him, and began telling him about the situation at the place where they'd be going.
Sabel: "We're going to Dune village. Eryndor and the black guard were sighted in the forest next to that place.
Sabel: "The locals said there have been monsters lurking the forest ever since then, and they've been hearing loud sounds come from there every night."
Arin: "So we need to hurry if we want to catch Eryndor before he summons something worse."
Sabel: "Sadly, we can't simply rush in without a plan. We need to check on Dune's civilians first, and take measures to protect the village."
Sabel: "Eldric will also be arriving a few days late, so we will have to bide our time until then."
Arin thought for a moment.
Arin: "What if I scout ahead? With my magic, I can fly over the forest and see what's happening inside. Then, we can formulate an attack strategy accordingly."
Sabel: "That's not a bad idea. As long as you remain unnoticed, it may prove quite effective."
When the group of twenty-some soldiers arrived to Dune village, Sabel led them to the mayor's place, to ask him information about the village's layout.
Arin stayed only long enough to hear the whereabouts of the black guard's stronghold.
His exploration took him to the forest.
There, he spotted quite a lot of strange monsters, most numerous of them being small, red-skinned demons.
Getting close to the Dark Sorcerer's fortress let him discover a large creature standing next to it.
It looked like a human, but it was gigantic, and had only one eye on its face. On its hand, it held a big club.It followed the commands of a menacing-looking man clad in dark armor.
He looked vaguely familiar. While looking at him, Arin remembered.
He was among the people who raided his village!
That man, had he not been the one whom he blasted away, when he awakened his magic powers? If he had not gained his magic the moment he did, this man would have killed him, back at his village!
He felt anger rise within him, and decided that he needed to do something about it.
He knew that he could not fight alone against such a powerful foe, so he went back to tell Sabel everything he saw.
Together they came up with a plan to sneak into the fortress during the night, and free the captives before destroying the sorcerer himself.
Chapter 7: Infiltrating the Stronghold with Sabel
They trained hard every day, until the night Eldric arrived.
That night, Arin ad Sabel snuck through the woods, while Eldric and the kingdom's soldiers stayed at Dune village and protected it.
Eldric prepared a spell to cast lightnings onto Eryndor's fortress, drawing the mage's attention to him.
Sabel and Arin took advantage of the confusion to advance undetected through the forest, avoiding traps and guards alike, until they reached the walls of the fortress.
There, they found themselves facing an obstacle. A moat filled with water, surrounded by sharp rocks.
The only way across seemed to be a wooden bridge, which creaked ominously as they stepped onto it.
Suddenly, the bridge collapsed beneath them, sending them tumbling down towards the water below.
But Arin used his magic to slow their fall, and landed safely on the shore.
As soon as they landed, they noticed there was someone in the water.
It turned out to be a mermaid-like girl, who swam closer to the shore, looking at them with curiosity.
Mermaid: " Oh! Humans~ I haven't seen any humans around here lately."
Arin: "We are not just human... We are Battle Mages."
Mermaid: "Battle Mages? What does that mean?"
Arin explained what being a battle mage meant, and introduced himself and Sabel. 
Mermaid: Oh! I've heard stories about people like you! I've always wanted to meet warriors that wield magic!
Mermaid: "My name is May nice to meet you two. I live with my people in these woods.
But since those monsters and that spooky sorcerer arrived, the lake where we used to swim has been turned into a moat, and we can't come here safely."
May: "I've been trying to find a way to get back at them, and drive them away from our home."
Arin: "Well, you are in luck. That's exactly what we're here to do."
May: "Wonderful! I will help any way I can! And I think I know how..."
Sabel: "What do you have in mind?"
May: "I recently discovered an underwater passage leading directly into the fortress. I could show you the way, but... you humans can't breathe underwater, can you?"
Sabel: "I'll cast a spell to let us breathe underwater. That won't be an issue."
May: "Good. Then, follow me."
They agreed, and followed May deep into an underwater passage, where she led them through hidden passages and secret doors. Finally, they emerged at what seemed to be a dungeon, or a basement.
Inside, they found a group of prisoners, including some children. One of them caught sight of Arin, and called out to him.
Arin decided to free the prisoners, using his magic to open the cell doors.
Prisoner: "Thanks for saving us! They have been using us as sacrifices to summon demons and monsters!, and feeding us to them!"
Arin promised to investigate further, and left with Sabel and May.
As they made their way back up to the surface, Arin wondered if he would ever truly feel safe again, after everything he had gone through.
But he also felt determined to keep fighting against those who threatened innocent people, no matter what it took.
Soon enough, Arin and his group reached the stairs leading to the higher floors of the fortress. In front of them, three knights in black armor stood, blocking the way. Members of the Black Guard, no doubt.
One of them, the one with the fanciest armor, took off his helmet. It was the same one he ha seen before. The man that attacked him back at the village.
Black Guard: "You!"
Sabel: "Watch out, Arin. That is Thal, the leader of the Black Guard!"
Arin drew his sword, ready to fight. He knew this wouldn't end well, but he couldn't let these men get away with hurting anyone else.
The battle began, and it was fierce.
Arin fought hard, using all the skills he learned during his training.
With each blow, he could feel himself getting stronger, more confident. Sabel took on the two other knights, while May hid away from the fray.
She opened her mouth and sang, her melody reinforcing Arin and Sabel's magical attacks.
Meanwhile, Arin was face to face with that man from before. He tried casting his bolt of light onto him, just like back then, but this time, the spell was deflected!
Thal: "I won't fall for that trick twice, kid!"
He charged towards Arin, swinging his sword wildly. Arin dodged out of the way, barely avoiding being hit.
But as soon as he did, he saw an opportunity. He jumped forward, aiming right for Thal's chest.
Their swords clashed together, and Arin felt the power coursing through his veins.
This was what he had been waiting for - a real challenge.
With every ounce of strength he had left, Arin pushed against Thal's blade, trying to force him backwards.
Finally, after what seemed like hours, Thal stumbled backward, losing his footing.
Arin: "Take this!"
He cast a fireball at Thal, who screamed as he was engulfed in flames.
The heat was intense, but Arin didn't let up until Thal fell to the ground, defeated.
Satisfied with his victory, Arin turned around to see how Sabel was doing.
To his surprise, she was already standing over another fallen foes. It looked like she had taken care of things without any help needed.
Chapter 8: The final battle
Sabel: "Let's not lower or guards just yet. We've still got to find Eryndor."
They continued onwards, determined to complete their mission no matter what obstacles lay ahead.
As they walked deeper into the fortress, it became darker and more ominous. They could hear strange sounds coming from all directions, making it hard to tell where the danger was coming from.
But eventually, they came across an imposing looking chamber, looking like a grand hall. In the center stood a throne made entirely out of black stone, surrounded by torches that flickered eerily.
And sitting upon the throne was none other than Eryndor himself, the Dark Sorcerer. He smiled wickedly when he saw them enter, and gestured towards the crowd of red-skinned demons surrounding him.
Eryndor: "Kill them, my minions!"
The minions charged forward, brandishing pikes and tridents. But before they could reach them, Sabel unleashed a barrage of magically charged slashes that sent them all flying backward.
Arin drew his own weapon, ready to fight alongside her. But Sabel put a hand on his shoulder, stopping him.
Sabel: "Leave the small fry to me. You need to take down Eryndor."
She started chanting a powerful incantation, while Arin watched as one of the beasts attacked her. She blocked its blow with ease and counterattacked, sending it hurtling backward.
Another two approached from either side, but she quickly dispatched both of them too.
Arin: "You're amazing, you know that?"
Sabel grinned proudly at the compliment.
After she had finished casting the spell, she turned around to face the sorcerer again.
Sabel: "Now, go after him. I'll cover you.
Arin nodded, and charged directly at Eryndor. He ignored the attacks from the minions around him, focusing instead solely on the Dark Sorcerer.
When he reached Eryndor, he swung his sword with all his might. Eryndor attempted to parry the strike, but was forced off balance by the strength of Arin's attack.
Suddenly, Eryndor turned his head and began laughing maniacally. As if summoning some kind of power from within, he cast a devastating fireball at Arin.
It hit with such force that it knocked him to the ground. But luckily, Sabel managed to shield herself and Arin from the worst of the explosion.
Eryndor: "Fool! You think you can best me? Within my stronghold? This ends now!"
Raising the glowing orb he held in his hand, he triggered a spell, and a large monster was summoned into the room. Arin recognized it.
It was the one-eyed giant he had seen wandering outside, during his initial scouting of the woods around the fortress.
Eryndor: "Attack them!"
The giant let out a roar and rushed towards them. The two battlemages were caught off guard by this sudden development, and barely avoided being crushed underfoot.
They would have to defeat the giant first before they could face Eryndor.But how? They couldn't use magic against it, or else it would just absorb their spells. They needed something physical, like a weapon.
Arin remembered one of the demons that attacked Sabel dropping a long spear lying on the floor earlier. He grabbed it and ran towards the creature, swinging the spear wildly.
Unfortunately, the giant was too fast, and easily dodged the attacks. Arin backed away, trying to find an opening.
Infusing magic into the spear, he hurled it at the beast, hoping to pierce its thick hide.
To his surprise, the spear actually stuck inside the giant's body.
With a loud cry, the beast fell to the ground, clutching at the shaft of the spear protruding from its chest.
Sabel quickly took advantage of the situation and began chanting another spell.
All the weapons the demons dropped rose in the air and flew directly towards the fallen creature.
All at once, they stabbed into the giant's thick skin, and while many of them were deflected, many of them pierced it and lodged themselves inside.
Letting out a horrifying yell, the giant slumped and stopped moving.
Eryndor: "Curses! I should have summoned a stronger monster!"
Sabel grinned triumphantly at the sorcerer.
Sabel:"Not so tough now, are you?"
She turned to look at Arin. He was still catching his breath from their fight, but he looked incredibly proud of himself.
Sabel: "Well done, Arin. Now let's finish this."
And with that, she led the charge towards Eryndor, with Arin following close behind her.
The battle against Eryndor proved to be a difficult one. The dark sorcerer was skilled and powerful, and put up a great resistance.
However, Sabel and Arin were determined not to lose.
With their powers combined, they managed to weaken Eryndor significantly. Finally, when Eryndor attempted to cast a deadly spell, the two battlemages were able to overcome him.
Using all their remaining strength, they channeled their magical energy through the glowing orb, destroying it, and causing Eryndor to fall backwards.
Sabel: "We did it!"
Arin collapsed next to her, exhausted after the long fight. They had finally defeated Eryndor... or so it seemed.
Eryndor: "What have you done? You fools! Now that my orb is broken, no one can control the monsters anymore! Now my ultimate weapon will go rogue!"
From the ruins of the tower, a massive green dragon emerged. Its scales glinted in the light, and its eyes burned like hot coals. It let out a deafening roar.
Arin: "What is that?!"
Sabel: "Another summoned monster!?"
The dragon breathed fire down upon them, which Sabel swiftly countered with ice magic. But the dragon was too strong, and kept coming back for more.
In the middle of the confusion, the Dark Sorcerer, which had fallen down, stood up, and began to cast a spell to teleport out of here.
Arin: "Wait, what is Eryndor doing?"
Eryndor cackled from afar.
Eryndor: "That should keep you busy for a while!"
Arin: "We need to stop him! He'll get away!"
Sabel: "Grr... If we let him escape now, he will be back someday to try and terrorize the kingdom again! But... at this rate, this dragon will destroy Dune village!"
Sabel: "Eldric won't be able to defend the villagers alone from an enemy like this!"
Arin: "Then what do we do?"
Sabel:"I don't know yet... we must think of something fast."
Arin raised a shield of light to protect Sabel from a massive claw slash from the dragon.
He grit his teeth and tried to think. What should he prioritize? Facing the green dragon, or stopping the Dark Sorcerer from escaping?
