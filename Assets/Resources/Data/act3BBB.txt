Chapter 9: Dragon Slayer.
After remembering the chaos his village suffered, Arin made up his mind. He could not allow that tragedy to repeat itself in Dune. Even if it meant having to let Eryndor flee, stopping the dragon was more important.
Without hesitation, Arin charged forward towards the dragon.Drawing upon the power of the Moon, he unleashed a blinding beam of light directly at the dragon. The creature roared in pain as the light engulfed it. Sabel joined him, using her Ice magic to freeze the dragon and making it easier for them to defeat it.
May caught up with them at that point, and used her voice to empower Arin and Sabel. Even with her help, this was not going to be easy.
Eryndor: "You may have foiled my plan this time, but I'll be back! Mark my words, you haven't seen the last of me!"
With these parting words, Eryndor vanished into thin air, his spell complete.
Sabel, May, and Arin shared concerned glances, but they were still locked in combat with the green dragon and there was nothing they could do abut Eryndor fleeing. The dragon was massive, and incredibly powerful. Despite their best efforts, they couldn't seem to bring it down.
Arin: "We can't let this go on any longer! We have to find a way to stop the dragon!"
Suddenly, Arin remembered a piece of advice Eldric had given him during one of his training sessions, one in which Eldric had replaced Sabel, while she was gone on a mission for the kingdom.
Arin: "Quick, Sabel!Use your ice magic to freeze the ground where the dragon is standing!"
Sabel nodded, and immediately began to focus her energy. She created a large sheet of ice around the dragon.
Dragon: "Rrraaaaaaaa!"
The dragon roared furiously, trying to break through the frozen surface. That bought Arin enough time to run over and plunge his sword deep into one of the dragon's wings.
The dragon, now unable to fly, snarled, trying to slash at the battle mages with its claws.
Arin and Sabel continued to attack it relentlessly, spending their magic resources into raising barriers to keep themselves safe from its fiery breath.
Raising its long tail, the dragon flung it at Arin and Sabel, knocking them off balance.
May: "Now, Arin! Use your Lightning Strike!"
Arin nodded, and quickly channeled all of his remaining magic into the spell. A bolt of lightning shot out towards the dragon, striking it right in the heart.
The dragon convulsed, and then collapsed onto the ground, defeated. Its mighty body began to turn into ash, leaving behind only a small pile of dust and scales.
May, Sabel, and Arin stood together, exhausted but victorious. They had finally managed to defeat the green dragon that Eryndor had summoned.
They could not afford to celebrate yet, though. With Eryndor's orb gone, all the demons and monsters under his control would fall into a frenzy. No longer following orders, they might flee from the fortress and stop attacking Dune village. But there was no way to know for sure.
And even then, the remnants of the Black Guard would still be trying to assault the village, not knowing that their leader was gone.
As things calmed down, the three of them collected the green dragon scales and walked out of the fortress, lamenting the fact that Eryndor had escaped.
Arin: "This does not feel like a success. The Dark Sorcerer escaped, and now we have no idea of where he'll go, or what his plans are."
Sabel: "That is a shame, but look at it on the bright side. Dune Village would not have survived that dragon's attack."
May: "I think we did the right thing. I've only known you for a few hours, but you're already proving yourself to be a great mage, Arin. I am proud to fight by your side."
Arin smiled warmly, glad to have such experienced companions at his side. He knew they were right; their victory against the dragon was worth celebrating. But as they made their way back to the village, Arin couldn't help feeling anxious about the future. Would they ever be able to truly defeat Eryndor?
With the green dragon vanquished and Eryndor missing, May, Sabel, and Arin returned to Dune village. Eldric and the kingdom's soldiers looked exhausted, and a few of them were injured, but thankfully, it looked like everyone had made it out of the raid just fine. The buildings had survived too, and a bunch of civilians were assisting them in any way they could.
The old wizard saw them arrive and waved at them.
Eldric: "Well done, my friends. You have saved the day once again."
May smiled at Arin and Sabel.
May: "I knew you could do it!"
Arin: "Thank you, everyone, for helping us. I don't think we could have defeated the dragon without your support."
Sabel nodded. "It wasn't easy, but with our combined efforts, we managed to bring it down. And now, let's see if we can get some rest before anything else happens."
Eldric approached them and clapped his hands.
Eldric: "First, you must come and celebrate. There is much to drink and feast on. Your deeds deserve no less. The mayor is thankful to us, who fought to defend his village and his people. He's throwing a feast for us!"
May grinned, licking her lips.
May: "Celebration? Will there be cake?"
Arin laughed, teasing the mermaid.
Arin:  "There is always cake, May."
May: "Hey! Don't laugh at me. Cake is serious business."
She stuck out her tongue playfully. The mermaid girl and the human boy broke into laughter together.
Soon enough, the villagers gathered around them, happy that their heroes were safe and well. Arin spoke to the crowd, telling them that Eryndor had escaped, but they should not worry. He assured them that he would return soon, and this time, they would end him for good.
Arin: "We will continue to hunt Eryndor until we find him. Until then, you are all safe here in Dune Village. Rest easy, knowing that we will protect you."
The villagers cheered loudly, and the celebrations began. Arin, May, Sabel, and Eldric drank and ate their fill, enjoying the company of their new friends.
For now, peace reigned over Dune Village once more.
A few days later, Arin and his group returned to Ralz village. 
His family welcomed him with open arms, and he was pleased to see that his father had recovered from his injuries sustained during the attack on their home.
Mom: "My son, it is so good to have you back safely. We feared for your life, but you have proven yourself to be brave and strong."
Arin hugged his mother tightly. His father rubbed Arin's hair with his hand, proudly. Irina's attention fell quickly on the mermaid girl that walked so close to the boy. Her eyes brightened as she stared at May, taking in every detail of her appearance. It wasn't long before the two girls were chatting and giggling together like old friends.
After spending time with his family, Arin decided to visit Sabel, who had finally settled at her home. When Arin approached her, Sabel looked up and greeted him warmly.
Sabel: "Ah, Arin. Good morning to you. How are you doing?"
Arin sat beside her on the bench outside her house.
Arin: "I'm good, thanks. Just catching up with my family after everything that has happened."
Sabel nodded, understanding. She took a sip of her tea and gazed out at the beautiful scenery that surrounded her.
Sabel: "It is quite peaceful here, isn't it? I feel lucky to have found such tranquility."
Arin agreed. The village was idyllic, and he hoped that they could stay here for many years to come. He turned his attention to the Battlemage.
Arin: "Yeah. And I imagine we'll have to make sure it stays that way."
Sabel smiled faintly.
Sabel: "Indeed. I've already informed the King of the situation with Eryndor. As soon as we learn where he's gone, we'll be ready to go look for him. But for now, let us enjoy this brief period of calm while we can."
Arin couldn't help but smile at the thought of going on an adventure again. Despite all the hardships they faced, he enjoyed the thrill of combat and the satisfaction that came with emerging victorious.
They spent hours talking about their experiences and future plans. By the end of the day, both knew that no matter what obstacles lay ahead, they would face them together.
The end.
