Arin sat in his chair, weighing his options. On one hand, Sabel's aggressive approach was exciting and promising, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he was meant for something more. Eldric's calm and measured approach resonated with him, and he couldn't ignore the respect and admiration he had for the man.
In the end, Arin decided to go with his gut and chose Eldric as his mentor.
Arin: "I'd like to train with Master Eldric."
Sabel raised an eyebrow in surprise.
Sabel: "Eldric? I thought for sure you'd choose me."
Arin: "Your abilities are impressive, but Eldric's approach feels like the right fit for me."
His sister, always the curious one, piped up.
Irina: "What will you learn, Arin? Can you teach me too?"
Arin grinned. "Who knows? Maybe I can teach you a thing or two."
Eldric let out an amused sigh, watching the conversation unfold.
Eldric: "So, you've made your decision"
Arin: "Yes, I have. Please teach me, Master Eldric."
Eldric smiled warmly.
Eldric: "Very well. I believe we will do great things together."
Sabel's expression was a bit more reserved, but she nodded in acceptance.
Sabel: "I understand, Arin. I wish you the best of luck in your training. If you need me for anything, I'll be around."
Arin felt a pang of guilt. He knew that he had disappointed Sabel, and wished there was a way to train with both of them. But he also understood that he had to follow his heart and chose the mentor that felt just right.
Sabel smiled understandingly.
Sabel: "I'm sure you'll learn a lot under Eldric's guidance. Perhaps you'll get to show me how much you've grown, once your training concludes."
She walked on to where Irina and his mother was, and sat next to them, promising them to take them to where the injured survivors they rescued were, later.
Eldric turned to him.
Eldric: "Now, as for your training. We'll begin in a week's time. Until then, I suggest you rest and prepare yourself. It won't be easy, but I promise it will be worth it."
Arin nodded, feeling a mix of confidence and determination.
Arin: "Thank you, Master Eldric."
Eldric smiles kindly. "You can call me Eldric, Arin. We will be spending a lot of time together, after all."
They discussed the details of Arin's training, including the types of magic he will learn, the physical training he will undergo, and the expected duration of his training.
Eldric emphasized the importance of discipline and dedication, and warned Arin that the road ahead wouldn't be easy.
Arin listened attentively, his mind already buzzing with possibilities. He couldn't wait to start his journey and unlock the full potential of his magic.
Once the meeting came to a close, Eldric stopped Arin, as he headed for the door.
Eldric: "I have arranged for you to stay in a room in the tower during your training period. It is not luxurious, but it will provide you with a quiet space to focus on your studies."
Arin: "Can I really stay here? Thank you very much, Master Eldric!"
He bowed, respectfully.
Eldric shook his head, amused.
Eldric: "When we're both alone you don't need to call me 'Master' everytime. just 'Eldric' works just fine."
Chapter 4: The Training Begins.
Arin spent the week leading up to his training with Eldric in deep preparation. He studied every book on magic and combat that he could find in the village library, eager to learn all he could before beginning his official training.
The books didn’t provide much help, but they helped him familiarize himself with the basics of magic.
In addition to his mental workout, Arin made sure to spend time with his family, knowing that he might not have much time for them once his training began.
He took Irina on walks in the forest, played games with her, and helped his mother care for his bedridden father.
At night, Arin lay awake, wondering what his training would be like. Would it be as intense as Sabel's training would have been?
Would it be enough to let him protect his people, should something like what had happened the other day happen again?
What would he do if the assaulters came back before he was ready to face them? He looked forward to it but also felt a little anxious.
As the week drew to a close, Arin packed his bags, double-checked that he had everything he needed.
Eldric had already told him that he would be staying in a small room in the tower, so he didn't need to worry about finding a place to stay.
Finally, the day arrived. Arin woke up early, his heart racing with anticipation. He ate a quick breakfast and set off for Eldric's tower, his bags in tow.
Arin arrived at Eldric's tower a while later, carrying his belongings. He approached the door, stepping firmly on each step of the stairs, psyching himself up.
This was the beginning of his journey to become a powerful mage.
Eldric greeted him at the tower’s entrance and led him to a small room where Arin could keep his things.
Eldric: "Welcome, Arin. Are you ready to begin your training?"
Arin nodded, trying to suppress the butterflies in his stomach.
Arin: "Yes, I wam. What will we be doing first?"
Eldric smiled, pleased to see him this eager.
Eldric: "First, we'll work on basic control exercises. We'll start with some simple spells and build from there. But before we begin, let me show you to your quarters."
He led Arin to a small room with a bed, a desk, and a bookshelf.
Eldric: "This will be your home for the next few months. Make yourself comfortable."
Arin nodded, taking a look around the room. It was simple but cozy. He felt a sense of excitement and responsibility settle over him as he realized that this was his new life.
The old wizard gave him a warm smile.
Eldric: "Follow me. We had much to do."
After dropping off his things, Arin followed Eldric to a spacious room filled with books, potions, and various magical artifacts. There was a large circle etched onto the floor, and Eldric gestured for Arin to stand in the center of it.
Eldric: "As I said earlier, we'll work on some basic control exercises."
Eldric: "Focus your mind and try to feel the magic within you. Try to control it and make it do what you want."
Arin took a deep breath and closed his eyes, trying to focus his mind. He imagined a small ball of light forming in his hand, and after a moment, he felt a faint warmth there.
He opened his eyes to see a faint glow emanating from his palm.
Eldric nodded in approval. "Good. Keep practicing that for a bit, and we'll move on to the next exercise soon."
The young boy trained during the whole day, focusing on the basic control exercises that Eldric had assigned him.
The exercises consisted of focusing and controlling his magic, starting with simple movements of objects to more complex spells.
As he practiced, Eldric took the opportunity to tell him about magic.
Eldric: "Magic is a force that flows through all things. It can be harnessed and controlled by those who possess the talent for it. However, it is not without risk.
Eldric: "Magic can be dangerous and unpredictable, and using it requires great discipline and responsibility."
Arin nodded, absorbing every word.
Arin: "I understand, Master Eldric."
A while later, the wizard led Arin to a spacious training room, where several wooden dummies were set up.
Eldric: "Next, we will try something a little more challenging. Magic required a clear mind and precise movements. I want you to focus on the dummies and push them away using your magic."
Arin took a deep breath, centered himself. He stretched out his hand and concentrated, imagining the wooden dummy moving.
At first, nothing happened. But after several attempts, he felt a faint tingling in his fingertips. He focused harder, pouring more of his energy into the spell.
Suddenly, the dummy lurched backwards, its wooden arms flailing, as if it had been struck. Eldric clapped his hands in approval.
Eldric: "Well done, Arin! You had a natural talent for this."
Arin grinned, feeling a sense of pride swell within him. Under his master’s supervision, he spent the rest of the day trying to push the training dummies
He had to focus for a few minutes to give his target a brief push, and it wasn’t enough to topple the dummy. But the more he repeated the exercise, the less time it took him to make it happen again.
When Arin began to feel a slight headache, Eldric decided to conclude the training session.
The two of them had a quiet dinner, and Arin returned to his room, feeling exhaustion pile up on him. He may have pushed himself a little too hard earlier. It did not take him long to fall asleep.
The next morning, Arin woke up feeling a bit sore from yesterday's training. He stretched his muscles and took a deep breath before heading downstairs to meet Eldric.
As he entered the training room, Eldric greeted him with a nod and handed him a small wooden box.
Eldric: "Today's exercise is a bit more difficult than yesterday's. Inside this box are three small stones. Your task is to levitate them in the air and move them around the room using only your magic."
Arin nodded, took the box, and opened it. The stones inside were small, smooth, and grey. He concentrated on one of them and focused his magic on it. He tried to lift it, but nothing happened.
He tried again and again, but the stone remained stubbornly on the ground. He could feel his frustration growing and his concentration slipping. After a few more attempts, he set the stone down and took a deep breath.
The wizard noticed his struggle and offered some advice.
Eldric: "Remember to keep your mind clear and focused. Let your magic flow through you and feel its energy. Try to visualize the stone lifting off the ground, and then move it slowly through the air."
Arin took another deep breath and tried again. He concentrated, visualized, and tried to let his magic flow. This time, he managed to lift the stone a few inches off the ground, but it wobbled and fell back down.
Pushing the dummies backwards was easy compared to this because he did not have to maintain the pressure. Here, however, he had to keep pressing the stone upwards against gravity.
If he wanted to keep it in the air, he had to push constantly, without releasing the pressure, even for a moment. Alternatively, he could repeat the pushes quickly in rapid succession.
That way, he could keep sending the stone into the air. The boy experimented with both methods.
The second method was initially more successful, but it caused him to lose control of the stone as it traveled in an arc and fell back to the ground, away from him.
Arin resolved to try the first method instead—a single, sustained push upwards against gravity, which he had to maintain for as long as he could. Eldric simply watched. Thankfully, he did not rush the boy.
Eldric: "Good job, Arin. Keep practicing, and you will get the hang of it."
Arin spent the rest of the day practicing this exercise, struggling with the stones and trying to get them to move smoothly through the air.
By the end of the day, he managed to keep one of them levitating for a few minutes before it fell back down. Was he really supposed to lift all three stones at the same time?
He headed to bed that night feeling tired and frustrated but determined to keep working at it.
Chapter 5: Training and Revelations
Arin spent the next few days practicing with Eldric, focusing on extending the time he could keep a stone in the air. He felt like he was making progress and was starting to become more comfortable with using his magic.
However, whenever he tried to lift more than one stone at a time, he lost focus, and the stones came crashing down.
Eldric noticed Arin's struggle and told him not to worry too much, explaining that lifting multiple objects at once was a difficult task even for experienced magic users.
He told Arin to focus on mastering the basics before moving on to more complex exercises.
Despite his frustration, Arin continued to practice diligently, and gradually he was able to keep the stone in the air for longer and longer periods of time.
He felt a sense of accomplishment with each new milestone he achieved, and it motivated him to keep going.
As the days went by, Arin's control and focus improved, and he began to feel more confident in his abilities. However, he still had a long way to go before he could consider himself a skilled magic user.
During the evenings, Arin dined with his master and listened intently as Eldric described a villain known by the kingdom as the Dark Sorcerer's, and told him his history and the threats he posed to the kingdom.
Eldric: "You must remember, Arin, that the Dark Sorcerer weas an ambitious man. He would do whatever it took to gain power. He would use any means necessary, and he did not hesitate to destroy anyone who stood in his way."
Eldric: "He would even consort with monsters, and summon demons. This is what caused the kingdom's ire. Demons, as you know, feed on mortals, and try to rob them their souls, their powers and their very essence."
Eldric: "If the Dark Sorcerer were to gain control of a powerful enough monster or demon, and nurture it to become unstoppable, he could unleash devastating attacks on the kingdom and seize it for himself. That is his goal"
The wizard also told Arin about the measures the kingdom had taken to prevent the Sorcerer from achieving his goals. These measures included the formation of the Magic Council, a group of powerful mages who worked to protect the kingdom from magical threats.
Eldric: "I myself am a member of the Magic Council and had been involved in many missions to stop the Dark Sorcerer's agents from acquiring resources or expanding his influence."
Eldric: "Any groups who would support him have been long since outlawed."
Arin: "I see. But why are you telling me about this villain? Is there something I should know about him?"
Eldric: "You see... From the looks of it, he has recently joined forces with a group of mercenaries called the Black Guard. The thing is, Sabel talked to your father the other night, Arin. The Black guard attacked your village."
Arin: "Which means, this Dark Sorcerer you're telling me about is related to the attack, as well. I get it now."
As Eldric spoke, Arin could sense the seriousness of the situation. He realized that his training was not just about learning magic but also about protecting the kingdom from those who sought to harm it.
He asked Eldric what he could do to help, and Eldric told him that he would have a chance to prove himself after he took his graduation test. With this new sense of purpose, Arin continued his training with renewed determination.
He knew that he had a long way to go before he could face the Dark Sorcerer, but he was more determined than ever to become a powerful mage and protect the kingdom from harm.
One day, Eldric pulled a large wooden chest from a corner of the training room.
Eldric: "Arin, I have a new exercise for you. You haven't yet succeeded in moving all three stones with your magic, but I want you to try this next."
Arin nodded eagerly, excited to continue his progress.
Arin: "What do I have to do?"
The wizard places his hands on the lid of the chest.
Eldric: "I want you to move this chest. Use your magic to make it move in a circular motion around you. You must keep it moving in a circle for at least a minute."
Arin looked at the chest skeptically. It was larger than anything he had moved before.
Arin: "I can do this. It's bigger than my training stone, but it is only one item. I just have to put more power into it."
Eldric nodded at his apprentice's enthusiasm.
Eldric: "The point here is to accurately control its trajectory, rather than just keeping it floating in the air. Remember to stay focused and use your breath to control your magic."
Eldric: "And don't be discouraged if it doesn't work right away. It took time and practice to master these exercises."
Arin smiled at his teacher, feeling a little more confident. He took a deep breath and focused his mind on the chest. He raised his hands, palms facing outward, and began to channel his magic into them.
The chest began to lift off the ground, and Arin tried to move it in a circular motion around him. But after a few seconds, the chest wobbled and fell back to the ground with a thud.
Arin: "Ah! Damn it. Trying to move it without dropping it was harder than I thought."
Arin gritted his teeth in frustration. He tried again, but he couldn't seem to get the chest to move in a smooth circle.
He spent the rest of the day alternating between trying to circle the chest around him and attempting to levitate three stones at once, feeling like he wasn't making any progress at all.
Arin spent several days trying different approaches to master the new exercise Eldric had given him. He tried focusing on different parts of the chest, changing the speed of the object's rotation, and even experimented with different hand movements.
Despite his efforts, he couldn't seem to get the hang of it, and he grew increasingly impatient.
He was about to stop for the day when he had an idea. Instead of trying to force the chest to move through magical pushes and pressure, he focused on the feeling of his magic and how it interacted with his target.
He realized that he needed to let his magic flow through the chest, rather than trying to push it with force.
Arin concentrated, letting his magic flow through the object. At first, the object wobbled and moved unpredictably, but once the magic latched onto the chest and imbued it, Arin gradually gained more control over it. He made his magic move in a smooth, circular motion around him, and the chest followed the flow. He was thrilled with his progress and continued to practice the exercise, extending the time he could maintain control. Sometimes, he visualized his magic as a current of wind, or water, carrying the chest along. Other times, the magic took the form of a string or a chain, which he could tug to pull the chest.
The boy started to experiment with this new technique and found that he could also apply it to the three stones he had been struggling with earlier. Linking them with his magic, he was able to make all three of them float.
Moving one of the stones caused the others to follow it along. With continued practice, he gradually gained better control and made significant progress.
Eldric noticed Arin's progress and congratulated him on his breakthrough. He reminded Arin that magic was not just about brute force but also required finesse, control, and a strong mental image of the effect one wanted to accomplish.
Eldric: "It's good that you've found a technique that works for you. But remember to stay flexible in your approach. As you continue to learn, you may find that there are even better ways to control your magic."
Arin took this to heart and continued to practice the exercise with newfound enthusiasm.
Eldric: "Very well done. You've mastered all the exercises so far. And in doing so, you've developed your latent powers and learned how to use them. Now you have a solid base from which to improve on your own."
Eldric: "Next, you will put what you've learned into practice in order to cast a proper spell. Watch me."
The old mage demonstrated the spell by waving his hands in a circular motion while muttering a chant under his breath. Immediately, all the nearby objects, including training dummies, small rocks, and even wooden logs, started flying towards him.
With a wave of his hand, Eldric directed the objects to form a sturdy wall in front of him. Arin watched in amazement as the wall took shape.
It was made up of various objects, from the soft dummies to the hard logs, combined into a barrier of debris. The wall looked sturdy, and he was curious about its strength.
Eldric: "This spell is incredibly useful when you're under attack. You can use it to gather objects and form a protective wall to shield yourself from harm. And when you're ready, you can turn it into a powerful weapon by shooting it at your enemy."
Arin understood how the spell worked, in theory. It wasn't all that different from what he had been doing during his practice. But the amount and size of solid bodies involved were much higher.
Arin: "I'll need to keep pushing my limits if I wanted to pull that off, won't I?"
He hummed, watching as his teacher dispelled the wall, returning each and every item to the spot in the room they previously occupied.
Eldric: "Correct. Your graduation exam will be in a month. You will need to be able to cast this spell by then. The size of the wall is important, but what really matters is that it remains sturdy and unbroken, even if the enemy strikes at it."
As the day came to a close, Eldric called the training session early and, over dinner, wished Arin luck on his graduation test.
Eldric: "Remember, Arin," he said, "you have come a long way since we first met. You have grown stronger and more skilled with your magic. I have faith in you, and I know that you will succeed."
With that, Arin headed off to bed, ready to make the most of the last stretch of his apprenticeship under Eldric's guidance.
Chapter 6: The Graduation Exam
Arin spent the rest of the month practicing the new spell Eldric had taught him, taking every opportunity to practice it. He spent hours in the training room, gathering objects and trying to form walls with them, only to shoot them as projectiles afterward, and even trying to improve the spell further. Adding more things to his walls made them bigger, but the energy he spent on maintaining them increased as well.
He endeavored to make bigger walls each time, as well as to find the optimal size to sustain the wall for a long time.
During that month, he barely saw Eldric or Sabel, who were busy with their own work. Arin began to feel the weight of responsibility on his shoulders as he knew the exam was approaching fast.
He also started to worry that he might not be good enough, that he might fail the test and disappoint his master and mentor.
Despite his fears, Arin persevered and continued to practice every day, determined to master the spell and pass the test with flying colors.
Time flew by, and before Arin could tell, the day of the test arrived. Arin felt nervous but excited to demonstrate his progress to Eldric and Sabel.
The two of them waited for him in a large, specially prepared room in Eldric's tower. Chunks of rock, steel, and wood were scattered all over the place.
In the center of the room, there was a thick stone wall that separated the room into two halves. The wall was smooth and without any visible cracks or openings.
Eldric: "Arin, you have come a long way in your training, but this is the final test you must pass to complete my training and be declared a full-fledged mage."
Eldric: "You must use the spell I taught you to create a wall strong enough to withstand the full force of my magic. The wall must protect you from the blast and remain standing. Do you understand?"
Arin steadied his nerves and nodded, his eyes fixed on Eldric. His master and Sabel traded quiet glances, after which the veteran Battle Mage spoke.
Sabel: "I have another condition you need to meet to pass the test."
Arin gulped, already knowing that it wouldn't be an easy request.
Sabel: "You have to not only block Eldric's spells but also keep the magic wall up for at least five minutes."
Arin's heart raced as he realized how difficult the task was going to be. Blocking Eldric's spells was already a big challenge, but keeping the wall up for such a long time would be almost impossible.
Unless he made it small. But, would a small wall be able to block Eldric’s spells?
"I understand."
He tried to keep his voice from trembling.
Eldric crossed his arms, taking a step forward.
Eldric: "Remember what I taught you, Arin. Trust your instincts and your magic."
Arin stood in the center of the room, waiting for Eldric to begin the exam. The air was tense, and Arin could feel his heart pounding in his chest.Eldric walked up to the wall of the room and nodded at Sabel, indicating that she should begin the test.
Sabel stood at the other side of the room, her arms crossed. She closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, Arin saw them shine in a bright flash of light. "Begin!" her voice echoed through the chamber, as a luminous barrier protected the walls of the room from harm.
He immediately raised his hands and cast the spell Eldric had taught him.
Arin focused on the spell, drawing on his magical energy to create a barrier out of the objects around him. He could feel the power coursing through him, and he watched in amazement as the barrier took shape before him.
He did not know how strong his teacher’s attacks would be, so he pulled as many stones and chunks of metal as he could, just in case.
At that moment, Eldric's first attack hit the barrier, and Arin felt his strength waver. He gritted his teeth and tried to hold on, but the blast was too powerful. The barrier shattered, and Arin staggered backwards, struggling to keep his footing.
Arin: “Oh no! Did I lose?”
Sabel: “I never said you only had one try. The exam is not over yet. If you still have strength left, make a new shield and try again.”
Arin: “Okay. This time, for sure!”
He took a deep breath and looked up at Eldric, determination in his eyes. He knew that he could do this. He raised his hands again and began to cast the spell once more.
This time, Arin focused harder than ever, drawing on all of his magical energy.
Arin: “Master Eldric’s blast of magic was intense, but… its size was smaller than I expected! I will reduce the size and make sure it lasts, this time.”
Eldric: “Hmhmhm. Is that so? Let’s see if it makes any difference, then.”
The boy felt his muscles tense as he held the barrier in place against Eldric's attacks. Two magic blasts, one after another. Chunks of rock and metal flew off his magic wall, making dents into it. Sweat dripped down his face, and his breath came in short gasps.
But he didn't give up. The wall he made was cracked, but it still stood. He kept holding the barrier in place, even as Eldric increased the intensity of his attacks. Arin could feel the strain on his body, but he refused to give in.
Between bursts of magic attacks from the wizard, Arin pulled the chunks of wood he had left aside and made them float up to the shield-like wall he had erected in front of himself, patching it up where it looked especially frail.
The barrage of spells seemed to last an eternity, and the boy lost track of time. If he relaxed for a single moment, it would all be over.
Finally, Eldric's attack subsided, and Arin lowered his hands, panting heavily. He looked up at Eldric and Sabel, waiting for their verdict.
Sabel: "It’s been five minutes. Arin passed, as far as I’m concerned.”
Eldric: “It’s decided, then. Arin, you’ve passed the test. You may call yourself a Mage, from now on.”
As soon as Arin heard Eldric's announcement, he felt an overwhelming sense of relief. He had managed to do it, somehow. Eldric walked over to him, beaming with pride, and pats him on the back.
Eldric: "Good job, Arin! You did great!"
Arin grinned, feeling proud of himself. He had proven to Eldric and Sabel that he was worthy of becoming a mage. Sabel walked up to him and handed him a badge, congratulating him on his success.
Sabel: "Congratulations, Arin. You have officially graduated from your apprenticeship and are now a full-fledged mage. This is just the beginning, though, so don’t begin slacking now. You still have much to learn.”
Arin: “O-of course, Master Sabel! I’ll do my best!”
Arin took the badge, feeling a sense of pride wash over him. He had worked very hard for this moment, and it had finally paid off. He had achieved his goal of becoming a proper mage, and now he could begin a new chapter in his life.
Arin: "Thank you both for everything. I couldn't have done it without your guidance."
Sabel: “Heh, I barely did anything, kid”
Sabel smirked, dismissing the spell she had used to protect the walls of the room from Eldric’s blasts of magic.
Eldric smiled warmly at him. 
Eldric: "You're welcome, Arin. We knew you had it in you. Now you can go out into the world and make us proud.”
Sabel: “But before any of that? Tonight, we’re going to celebrate. We will throw a banquet at the town’s hall. Drinks are on me.”
Eldric groaned, good-naturedly.
Eldric: “Sabel, you know I don’t drink alcohol.” 
The Battle Mage stuck her tongue out at her companion.
Sabel: “Your loss.” 
Arin couldn’t help but laugh at their banter as he felt the tension and stress that had built up before the test completely evaporate.
Sabel left the tower to arrange tonight’s party, and Eldric began cleaning up the chamber where the two of them had fought.
Arin returned to his bedroom and sat down on his bed, resting his exhausted body. A satisfied sigh escaped from his mouth.
He knew that his journey as a mage was just beginning, and he couldn’t wait to see where it would take him.

Chapter 7: Call for adventure.

Arin woke up, feeling well-rested after a night of partying, and the sleep that followed.
He headed to the kitchen, hoping there might be some breakfast waiting for him.
His mother greeted him with a big smile when he entered the room.
Mom: "Good morning, dear! How are you feeling?"
Arin: "I'm doing great. I still can't believe I've become a mage. With these powers I've gained, I should be able to face whatever challenges lie ahead."
Mom nodded with a proud expression on her face.
Carmen: "That's what I like to hear! And we are so happy to have our little boy back home safely."
Arin hugged his mother tightly, thankful that they were all reunited again.
Irina: "Big brother! Won't you teach me magic as well? You said you would, but you've been busy with training all the time..."
His little sister sulked.
Arin: "Of course, I'll start teaching you magic right away!"
Irina giggled happily, running up to give Arin another hug.
Arin smiled affectionately at his sibling, knowing that she looked up to him as her role model.
Soon after breakfast, Sabel came by the house and picked up Arin. There were important news she had to discuss with him and Eldric.They decided to walk towards Eldric's tower together, enjoying the fresh morning air.

Sabel brought up something troubling she had heard from one of her sources in the city guard.
Sabel: "Apparently, there has been an increase in activity by bandits along the trade routes leading to Dune Village."
Arin frowned, concerned about the safety of travelers using those roads.
Arin: "Do you think it could be related to the Dark Sorcerer?"
Sabel shrugged.
Sabel: "It's possible. His influence seems to be spreading across the land. But honestly, I don't know much more than that."
Eldric nodded in agreement.
Eldric: "We need to investigate this further. If the Black Guard is behind these attacks,we must put a stop to it."
Arin knew that a trip through the dangerous forest would be required to reach the bandit hideouts. He also realized that this would be a perfect opportunity for him to use his powers to make a difference.
Arin: "I'm ready to help. What do you want me to do?"
Sabel and Eldric exchanged glances.
Sabel: "Well...the truth is, there may be a way to speed things up. But we need your help with it."
Eldric: "Yes. We've learned that the Dark Sorcerer possesses a powerful artifact called the Orb of Chaos. It is a type of arcane focus, attuned to demonic magic. It's rumored to grant its wielder immense power over chaotic forces, and even bring demons into our realm."
Sabel: "Fighting him while he is in the possession of this orb is very dangerous. But if we could steal it from him and use it against him,we might stand a chance."
Arin was stunned by the revelation. The thought of facing such a formidable foe made his heart race with excitement.
Arin: "How can I help?"
Sabel: "The plan is risky, but it's the best option we have. We will send you on a mission to sneak into thefortress where the Dark Sorcerer is hiding. Your task will be to find the orb and bring it back to us. Can you do that, Arin?"
Arin nodded determinedly.
Arin: "I'll get the orb. Don't worry."
Sabel gave Arin a reassuring pat on the shoulder.
Sabel: " Good luck, Arin. And remember, stay safe out there."

Chapter 8: Infiltration.

Arin and Eldric were walking through the dense woods, following an old path that led to the Black Guard's fortress. They moved silently, trying not to attract any unwanted attention.
Arin felt a sense of unease, knowing that they were trespassing on enemy territory. Every step he took increased the risk of being discovered.
Arin: "Are you sure this is the right way, Eldric? I feel like we're going in circles."
Eldric: "Trust me, kid. I've been here before. This path leads straight to the entrance of the fortress. Just follow my lead and stay close."
As they walked, Eldric kept scanning the surroundings, looking for signs of danger. His keen eyes spotted a movement in the bushes ahead.
Eldric: "Stop! There's someone ahead!"
Arin froze as Eldric reached for his sword. Moments later, a figure stepped out from the shadows. It was a Black Guard, armed with a spear and wearing dark leather armor.
Guard: "Halt! Who goes there?"
Eldric drew his own weapon and readied himself for battle.
The mercenary raised his spear, preparing to attack.Arin saw his chance and unleashed a blast of fire from his hand, striking the guard squarely in the chest. The impact sent the guard flying backwards, where he crashed into a tree and fell limp to the ground.
Arin turned to Eldric, feeling a surge of adrenaline.
Arin: "That was easy."
Eldric nodded in approval.
Eldric: "Good job. Now let's move quickly. We don't know how many more guards are waiting for us."
They continued their journey, moving cautiously through the woods. Soon they came across a large wooden gate, surrounded by towering walls and topped with sharp spikes.
Eldric signaled to Arin to wait while he examined the area. After a few moments,he returned with good news.
Eldric: "There's a secret passage behind those rocks over there. It should take us directly to the inner courtyard of the fortress without being noticed.Ready when I am?"
Arin nodded, holding his staff tightly.
Eldric led the way, and soon they found themselves standing at the mouth of the hidden tunnel.
Eldric: "After you, Arin."
Arin entered first, using his staff to light up the dark corridors. The passageway was damp and smelled of must, but it offered a safer route than risking being seen by the guards.
They walked for what seemed like hours, occasionally passing abandoned cells and storerooms. The further they went, the more impregnable the fortress appeared.
Finally, they arrived at a large metal door, sealed with a spell  that Arin would be able to dispel.
Eldric: "Once you open this lock, I will retreat, to cause a commotion. Use the time I'll buy you to find and extract the orb."
Arin nodded, taking a deep breath.
Arin: "Thanks for bringing me this far, Eldric. I owe you one."
Eldric patted him on the shoulder.
Eldric: "No problem. See you outside."
He cast a final look at Arin before disappearing back through the tunnel. A moment later, Arin heard the sound crackling lightning and explosions and the screams of men, signaling that Eldric had started his diversion.
Arin took a deep breath and faced the door. He concentrated, summoning all his magical power, and uttered the incantation to break the enchantment. Instantly, the heavy iron bars began to glow red hot, and the massive bolt snapped off its hinges.
The portal swung wide, revealing a dimly lit hallway beyond. Arin stepped inside cautiously, staff at the ready.
Inside, the corridors were empty and silent, save for an occasional dripping of water from above. Arin made his way deeper into the heart of the fortress, searching every room and cell he passed for any sign of the orb.
As he walked, he couldn't help but wonder what kind of evil lay withinthese walls. What did Eryndor, the Dark Sorcerer want with such a powerful artifact? And why was it so important that he keep it hidden?
Suddenly, Arin stopped in his tracks. Up ahead, he saw a faint golden glow emanating from beneath a closed door. His heart raced as he realized he might have finally found what he was looking for. Quietly, he approached the door and tried the handle. To his relief, it opened easily.
Arin peeked inside and his jaw dropped. There, on a stone pedestal in the center of the chamber, sat the Orb of Chaos, shimmering with an otherworldly light. But before he could reach for it, a voice spoke out from the darkness.
Eryndor: "Did you think I would not notice you scurrying around in my domains, boy?"
Arin froze. Turning slowly, he caught a glimpse of the sorcerer standing in the shadows, surrounded by an aura of black magic. Eryndor was tall and gaunt, with long white hair cascading down his shoulders.
"I should have known Eldric would come," said Eryndor, stepping forward. "But you are a surprise."
Arin raised his staff defensively.
Eryndor chuckled. "Do you really think that puny stick can harm me? I am Eryndor, the Dark Sorcerer. I rule here, and I will not be trifled with."
Arin clenched his teeth.
Arin: "You may have this place, but you don't own the world. And you certainly won't stop us from taking back the lands you destroyed, and the peaceful lives you ruined."
Eryndor shook his head, amused. "And who might that be?"
Arin glanced over at the orb.
Arin: "Those who seek to destroy you and everything you stand for."
Eryndor smiled coldly.
Eryndor: "Oh, I see. You speak for the Magic Council, do you? How quaint. Well, let me assure you, child. The balance between good and evil has already been established. It has endured for centuries, even through the greatest trials. And it will continue to prevail, no matter how many times fools like yourself try to upset it."
Arin didn't reply. He knew there was little point in arguing with Eryndor. Instead, he focused his attention on the orb once more.
Eryndor sighed.
Eryndor: "Very well. If that is your destiny, then so be it. But know this – if you attempt to take the orb, you will meet a swift and painful death."
With that, he lifted his hand and conjured a wave of dark magic. Arin barely had time to react as a bolt of energy shot towards him, narrowly missing his head. He stumbled backwards, staff at the ready.
Eryndor advanced, grinning malevolently.
Eryndor: "Shall we dance, boy?"
Arin held his ground, determined not to give an inch. But as he watched, Eryndor began to circle around him, striking out with blistering attacks that Arin barely managed to parry. Each blow sent shockwaves coursing through his body, sapping his strength.
Arin knew he couldn't hold out much longer. His arms were growing heavy, his vision beginning to dim. Discarding his own safety, he rushed towards the Orb of Chaos, dodging Eryndor's spells as he reached for it.
As soon as his hands landed on the orb, Arin felt the evil power within the magical artifact.
Eryndor roared in rage and charged forward, staff ablaze with black fire. Arin gritted his teeth and prepared for the final confrontation.
The Orb of Chaos glowed in Arin's hands, and he could feel a pulse from it. It was as if it were talking directly to his mind.
And Arin understood what the orb wanted. A sacrifice, in exchange of power.
In order to use this weapon against Eryndor, Arin would have to pay a high price.
What the orb desired from Arin was... His magic. Could he bring himself to part with his power, with his talent, all for the sake of taking down the Dark Sorcerer?
