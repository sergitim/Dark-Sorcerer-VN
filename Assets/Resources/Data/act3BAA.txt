Chapter 9: Gone Demons, Goodbye Irina.
Arin: "Irina, please forgive me..."
Irina's lips brushed his cheek softly, kissing him once before pulling back.
Irina: "It's okay. I forgive you. I love you, big brother."
Arin felt a lump in his throat, but he swallowed it down and kept talking.
Arin: "I love you too. Which is why, I have to do this. I know you don't want to end up becoming a monster like Eryndor. So, I'm going to help you. I'm going to send all of those demons back where they came from."
Sabel put a hand on Arin's shoulder, and gave him a comforting squeeze. Eldric nodded, looking down, saddened.
Arin: "And then, I'm going to use the Dark Sorcerer's Arcane Focus to banish you from our plane. You won't be able to hurt anyone. Okay?"
Arin's little sister nodded.
Irina: "I'm glad... It turned out like this. This really is... for the best."
The young mage nodded to her, raising the Arcane Focus in his hands, and willing all demons this artifact brought into his world, to disappear, one by one.
He started with the first demon Eryndor created, and moving on to the next, swiftly.
Arin: "With the last practitioner of demon summoning gone, and the magic study of demons becoming outlawed... Eryndor will be remembered as the last Dark Sorcerer."
Arin: "And you, Irina, will always be my adorable little sister."
Arin: "No matter where you are, or how much you change. That fact will remain forever true."
The demoness closed her eyes and nodded, resting her face against Arin, while waiting for her turn to be banished. There was nothing left for her to say.
Though, she met glances with Sabel and Eldric, and felt that perhaps, she did owe them an apology.
Irina: "Sabel, Eldric... sorry for attacking you earlier. I was not really myself."
Irina: "...I guess even now, I'm still not really myself, huh? Not entirely, at least."
The Battlemage, very carefully, extended a hand and rested it on the demoness's cheek.
Sabel: "Of course it is you. If back when we were fighting, you hadn't reacted to Arin's voice, you'd have devoured me and Eldric."
Sabel: "I don't think someone who isn't you would have fought back as hard as you did, when you heard him fight so hard for you."
The sagely wizard nodded, cupping the demoness's hand between his.
Eldric: "That is right. Your love for Arin saved our lives. We will never forget that. And we will never forget you, Irina."
Irina: "H-heheh... that feels pretty sappy... but thank you. I'll miss you, wherever it is that I'm going."
Arin: "And we will miss you too. Promise you'll be good?"
Irina: "Eheheh. Arin, you silly goof."
Irina: "look at me! Have you looked at these horns, these evil, glowing eyes, these sharp, life-sucking fangs, these bat-like wings?"
Irina: "Do I look like I'd be able to keep that promise for long?"
Arin: "...Promise?"
At his insistence, the former human girl couldn't help but blush, looking down, embarrassed.
Irina: "F-fine... I promise I'll be good. I'll be the goodest demon there ever was! Happy?"
Arin: "...Yeah."
She smiled, keeping her eyes closed, still.
Irina: "Take care of mom and dad, okay?"
Arin: "We will. Don't worry about them."
Irina: "Okay. Goodbye, guys. Thank you for everything."
With that, she vanished while still hugging Arin. The last one of the demons, gone forever.
There was only one thing left to do.
Arin held up the Arcane Focus and gazed into its depthless blackness, feeling a surge of power coursing through his veins.
He knew what he had to do. With a determined expression on his face, he placed it on the ground.
Raising his sword like Sabel taught him months ago, he shattered the infernal orb, releasing all the power it had stored.
It crackled briefly, and then, it crumbled away.
Arin: "It's over."
Sabel: "It's really over this time."
Eldric: "You did the right thing, Arin. You're a hero, you know?"
Arin: "I guess I am... Though I don't feel like one, right now."
Eldric put a hand on Arin's shoulder, comfortingly.
Sabel nodded, smiling at him.
Sabel: "You saved the kingdom and made the world a safer, better place, Arin. That's what matters most."
And so, they left the ruined city behind, leaving only memories of the past and hope for the future.
As they walked away, Arin couldn't help but wonder if he would ever see Irina again.
But for now, he was content knowing that he had done what he could to make the world a better place. And that was enough. 
The end.
