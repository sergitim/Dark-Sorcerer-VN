Arin thought for a moment.
Arin: "I think I'd prefer to learn from you, Sabel. You seems more focused on practical applications, whereas Eldric has a more theoretical approach.‚Äù
Plus, she was younger than him, so he felt he could relate better.
Sabel smiled and clapped her hands together.
Sabel: "Excellent! We shall start immediately then, Arin. Let's go find a quiet place where I can begin teaching you the basics of magic."
Arin nodded enthusiastically as they made their way through the tower towards a room filled with books.
Eldric stayed with Arin's mother and sister, deciding to help them find a place for them and Arin's husband to stay in Ralz, until they were ready to return to their destroyed village and rebuild their house.
As they entered the library room, Arin marveled at the countless shelves upon shelves of ancient tomes scattered throughout the room. The air smelled rich with age and knowledge, and it filled Arin with a sense of wonder and excitement.
Sabel stopped before a large bookshelf and pulled out a thick tome with a golden emblem on its cover. She held it up for Arin to see.
Sabel: "This is 'The Book of Magic,' written by the great mage Galadarion himself. It contains everything you need to know to become a powerful mage. Shall we start there?"
Arin: "We're starting with this book?"
Sabel: "For now, yes. This is a good starting point. Don't worry; it won't be boring, I promise."
Arin chuckled nervously.
Arin: "Alright, let's do it!"
Sabel nodded and began to read aloud from the ancient text, explaining each concept as she came across it. Arin listened intently, already beginning to feel the weight of the magical power within him. As the hours passed, he found himself growing more and more curious about the world of magic and sorcery, and couldn't wait to learn more.
It wasn't long before Arin realized that Sabel was right - learning magic really was exciting. And best of all, he knew that he now had the tools he needed to protect those he cared about.
Sabel: "I believe this is enough for today. Go with your family now, and we'll resume your teaching in the morning."
Arin: "Thank you, Sabel. I appreciate everything you've taught me so far."
Sabel: "Not a problem, Arin. Just remember to practice what you learned every day. You'll find that it becomes easier with time."
Arin nodded and walked over to his family, who were waiting for him near the entrance. As they left the tower, Arin looked back at the massive structure one final time, feeling a mixture of gratitude and determination.
He was determined to learn everything there was to know about magic, and become strong enough to protect everyone he loved. And if anyone ever tried to hurt them again, Arin vowed to stop them no matter the cost.
He also had to find out who the people that attacked his village was, and why they attacked them.
Chapter 3: Training with Sabel.
After a few weeks Arin began to improve greatly with his magic, and he even managed to cast a simple fireball spell after only a week of studying. However, using magic took quite a bit of energy, which worried him slightly.
If he used too much, it could leave him exhausted and unable to defend himself.But he'd have to trust in his abilities and his training to get him through any situation.
One day during his studies, he asked Sabel about the attack on his village. She told him that it was likely just bandits looking for easy targets, but that he should ask his father when he got better. Arin promised to do so.
As the days went by, Arin became increasingly skilled at casting basic spells, but Sabel was not satisfied only with that. She handed him a sword and shield and told him to start practicing combat.
Arin had never held a weapon before, let alone wielded one, but he picked up the sword and shield easily. Sabel showed him some stances and movements to help him fight more effectively.
At first, Arin struggled to block attacks and hit his opponent accurately, but soon his skills began to improve. Before long, he was able to hold his own against Sabel in a sparring match.
Arin's father noticed his progress and decided to teach him some additional combat techniques.
One afternoon, Arin's father took him aside and taught him how to use a bow.
Dad: "A bow is a valuable tool for any warrior. With it, you can attack your enemies from a distance, making it easier to avoid being struck yourself."
Arin watched as his father demonstrated proper aim and release. It didn't look very difficult, so he decided to give it a try.
He pulled back the string and let an arrow fly towards the target.It was certainly harder than expected. But with practice, Arin eventually got the hang of it, and his skill with the bow improved rapidly.
Soon enough, Arin found himself capable of hitting targets consistently and accurately. Sabel was pleased with his progress, and encouraged him to keep practicing.
One day, Arin's training took a turn for the unexpected.
While walking through town with Sabel, they passed by a small group of bandits attempting to rob an elderly couple.
Without hesitation, Arin drew his sword and charged towards the bandits, shouting a battle cry.
Sabel: "Arin! Wait!"
But it was too late. Arin had already engaged the bandits in combat.
He fought bravely, but he was outnumbered and overpowered. The old man and woman escaped unharmed, but Arin was knocked unconscious.
When Arin came to, he was lying on the ground with Sabel hovering overhead.
Sabel: "Are you alright? You took a pretty hard hit."
Arin rubbed his head where it hurt and sat up slowly.
Arin: "Yeah, I think so. Thanks for helping me."
Sabel: "You're welcome. But next time, remember to wait for my instructions before charging into danger. We'll deal with those bandits later. For now, let's get you back home."
Arin nodded, and they continued on their way. As they walked, Sabel explained what had happened. The bandits were notorious thieves who targeted unsuspecting travelers and villagers.
They had been terrorizing the surrounding area for weeks, and many people lived in fear of them.
Sabel: "I want you to be ready to defend yourself if ever confronted by such villains again. But always consider the consequences before acting rashly. Your life is too important to throw away needlessly."
Arin promised to listen carefully and to use his best judgement in future situations. Sabel seemed satisfied with this answer, and they continued on their way.
The boy reflected on the fight, that night. He had his magic, and his training with the sword and shield, and even his bow.
But he had still been overwhelmed by the bandits's sheer numbers. What was he missing?
He thought about it for the next few days, but he couldn't find a satisfying answer.
His training seemed to be progressing adequately, but he was beginning to wonder if it was going to be enough.
Not long after, Sabel watched him practice with his bow and his sword and decided it was time to take the training one step further.
Sabel: "Arin, I think it's time we started teaching you some real magic."
Arin: "Really?"
He had never actually used any of his magic outside of simple spell-casting exercises before.
Sabel: "Yes, and it's time you learned to use your abilities effectively in combat. You've learned how to use your magic an your weapons separately. Now, you will use them together. Try applying your magic to your sword as you slash with it."
Arin followed Sabel's instructions, focusing on using his magic to enhance the strength and speed of each strike.
It felt awkward at first, but soon enough he began to see results. The more he experimented, the better he became.
At some point, he could unleash a shockwave of light by slashing the air with his sword.
Sabel: "Good work, Arin! Next is your bow. Apply your power to each arrow you shoot. Try to make them fly faster and straighter."
Arin focused on channeling his magic into his arrows, and quickly discovered that they became much more powerful when enhanced by his magical energy.
He found himself able to hit distant targets more accurately than before.
In fact, his accuracy improved so dramatically that Sabel declared him ready to hunt for food and other supplies without assistance.
Arin: "I think I'm getting the hang of this."
Sabel: "Excellent. Practice makes perfect. Let's keep working on it until you can effortlessly cast and aim spells in battle."
And so they did, day after day.
With each passing week, Arin grew stronger, both physically and magically. He began to feel confident that he would be able to protect himself and others if necessary.
And while he knew there was still much to learn, he felt optimistic about the future.
As the months passed, Arin's skills with his bow, his sword, and his magic continued to improve rapidly under Sabel's guidance.
But something else was happening too - Arin was growing up. He was becoming more mature and responsible, taking on greater responsibilities around the house and in his community.
He helped his parents with chores, took care of his little sister, and even started assisting his neighbors with various tasks.
Irina was growing up quickly as well. While she lacked talent for magic, she also had their father teach her more about shooting arrows with a bow. She hoped to become a skilled archer like her father.
As for their mother, she continued to work as a healer and taught Irina some of her first-aid skills.
Overall, the family members were all developing their own interests while also supporting each other in their pursuits.
One evening, Arin returned home from his training with Sabel to find his family gathered around the table eating dinner. They greeted him warmly.
Irina: "Welcome home, big brother! How did training go today?"
The young man ruffled his sister's hair playfully.
Arin: "It went well today. I learned how to cast a spell that creates a shield around me and another one that makes my weapons glow brighter in battle. Sabel says I am making progress."
Mom: "That's wonderful to hear. We are proud of you, Arin. And we are grateful for your help around the house lately. You have been a great support to us during this difficult time."
Arin blushed at his mother's praise. He knew he still had much to learn, but he felt confident that he was on the right path.
With Sabel's guidance and his family's support, he believed he could achieve anything he set his mind to.
As they finished their meal, Arin's father set him aside. It was time to talk about something important.
Dad: "Son, I think it's time you and I had a talk."
Arin: "Is this about what happened to our village?"
Dad: "Yes..."
Dad: "Your mother and I want you to know that we are proud of you for wanting to seek revenge against those who attacked us."
Dad: "But we also want you to understand that vengeance is not always the best course of action. Sometimes, it can lead to more harm than good."
Arin listened intently to his father's words. He understood what he was saying.
Arin: "It is not about vengeance. I just want to make sure that no one else has to go through what we did. That is all."
Dad: "We understand that, son. And we appreciate your determination to protect your loved ones. But we also want you to be careful. Magic can be dangerous if used incorrectly or without caution. Remember that."
Arin nodded in agreement. He knew that his parents were only looking out for his well-being.
Arin: "I will. Now, what do you remember of the night of the assault on the village? Who were those guys wearing black armor?"
Dad: "They were part of an organization called the Black Guard. They were hired by someone named Eryndor Stoneheart to help him gain control over the region."
Arin: "The black guard again... Sabel said they attacked the village of Dren. I will look into this Eryndor. Maybe Sabel or Eldric will know something."
Dad: "Alright, son. Just promise you'll be careful. If it becomes too much, you know you can come back home."
Arin: "Thanks, Dad. I promise."
The two of them shared a comforting hug.
Chapter 4: Eryndor Stoneheart and the Black Guard
It turned out, Eldric was, in fact, familiar with Eryndor. He sat at a table across to Arin and Sabel, at his tower's parlor.
Eldric: "I know quite a bit about Eryndor Stoneheart. He is a powerful mage, though one that has been corrupted by vanity and greed."
Eldric: "He became infamous for using dark magic to achieve his goals. When the king sent an order to arrest him, he left his hometown and went into hiding."
Eldric: "But he swore that one day, the kingdom would belong to him, or else crumble under his power."
Sabel: "As for the Black Guard, I've been keeping track on them for a long time."
Sabel: "They're behind the recent wave of raids hitting all the major towns of this side of the kingdom."
Sabel: "Their leader, a man named Thal, seems to have some connection to Eryndor."
Sabel: "It's possible that they're working together to cause chaos and weaken the kingdom's defenses before making their move."
Arin: "We need to find Eryndor and stop him before he causes any more harm. We also need to disband the Black Guard. They're nothing but a group of thugs who are causing destruction wherever they go."
Eldric: "Agreed. Let me see what information I can gather on their whereabouts. In the meantime, we should continue our training so we can be ready for whatever comes next."
As they parted ways, Arin couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The threat posed by Eryndor and the Black Guard was real, and it seemed like they were just starting to scratch the surface of the problem.
But with Eldric and Sabel by his side, he knew that he could face anything that came his way.
The next few days were busy. Sabel decided Arin was reaching a stage at which he could aspire to officially be promoted to a fully capable, officially recognized rookie Battlemage.
He would have to pass a series of tests, including one that involved using magic to defend himself against multiple attackers.
All the tests would take place over the course of the same day, so he needed to devote himself to training to prepare for them.
Meanwhile, Arin continued to visit his family every evening, helping his father with his recovery, and trying to keep his sister Irina cheerful amidst the hardships they faced due to the raids.
Irina was eager to show Arin the progress she had made with the bow.
Irina: "Look! I can shoot an arrow through a small hole in the wall!"
Arin: "That's amazing! You're getting better and better."
Irina: "Thanks to you! Dad taught me everything he knows about archery."
Arin smiled, feeling proud of her accomplishments. She beamed a radiant smile at him, when he praised her. Then, as if bashful, she timidly asked her brother a question.
Irina: "Hey, big brother...When your finish your journey, you're going to go after the bad people who attacked our home, aren't you?"
Arin hesitated before answering truthfully.
Arin: "Yes, I am. But it won't be easy. They are strong and dangerous enemies. I need to prepare well for the fight ahead."
Irina nodded seriously, understanding the gravity of the situation.
Irina: "I've been working very hard too, so..."
Irina: "I want to help you in any way that I can. So let me come with you, when the day to go fight them arrives! Please...?"
Arin hesitated. It would put Irina in danger. And yet, he knew she was not so easily dissuaded.
Arin: "I'll... think about it. Okay sis?"
Irina: "Okay! Thank you, Arin!"
She hugged him tightly, and then went back to practicing her archery skills. Arin watched her with admiration, knowing how much she had grown since they had last visited Eldric's Tower.
He felt grateful for having such a brave and supportive sibling like Irina.
The day of the tests Sabel wanted to put Arin through was getting closer and closer.
Eldric had been locked in his study for a while, using his divination tools to discover Eryndor's whereabouts.
Sabel left the village frequently because she was called to the frontlines to combat foreign invaders, so she didn't have much time to personally oversee Arin's training. 
She made sure to give him a set of new exercises he had to practice while she was gone, though.
Sabel returned one evening, looking tired but satisfied.
Sabel: "Eryndor has been located. The war council has decided to launch an attack on his stronghold. We need to be ready for whatever he throws at us."
Arin: "I understand. What kind of magical creatures might we face in battle?"
Sabel: "There are reports of sirens, giants, and demons joining forces with Eryndor. We must prepare ourselves for anything."
Sabel: "If you want to come to the battle, you will have to pass the tests first."
Arin: "I know, Sabel. An apprentice doesn't belong in the battlefield. Before I can even dream of being deployed, I must prove myself."
Sabel: "So you understand. Good. I'm going to advance your test to the end of this week, then. If all goes well, we will be departing a couple of days after that."
Arin nodded gravely. He knew that this could very well be the fight of his life. But he was determined to protect those he cared about, no matter what.
As the day of the test drew nearer, Arin felt more nervous than ever before. He had never faced such a daunting challenge before, and he wasn't certain if he would be able to meet it.
However, he steeled himself and prepared as best he could.
Chapter 5: Battlemage Test
When the day arrived, Arin presented himself before the War Council. They explained the situation to him, and then set up a series of tests to determine whether or not he was ready for deployment.
The first test involved using his magic to create a shield around himself and others. He passed this test easily, creating a shield that protected everyone within it from harm.
Next, they tested his ability to use magic offensively. They provided him with a sword, and had Sabel use a spell to strengthen a group of training dummies.
War Council supervisor: "You have proven yourself capable in defensive magic, now let us see what you can do when attacking."
Arin took a deep breath and charged at the dummies with his sword raised high. As he swung downwards, Sabel cast a spell that made the dummies come to life.
The dummies attacked Arin, who fought them off with his sword and magic.
He successfully defeated all of the dummies, proving that he could use magic effectively in battle situations.
Finally, the War Council put Arin through one last test. A one on one duel against Sabel.
They would be using padded weapons, but Arin knew that this was no less important than the previous two tests.
Sabel used her magic to summon a storm, trying to blind Arin and disorient him.
But Arin remained calm and focused, using his own magic to counteract the storm and keep himself steady.
Even as she maintained the storm and assaulted his defenses, Sabel advanced towards him, wooden sword in hand.
Sabel: "Here I come, Arin. Show me what you've got!"
Arin: "I'm ready for you, Sabel! Witness the results of my training!"
They clashed swords, and Arin felt the power of Sabel's magic coursing through his veins. He pushed back against her, using his own magic to reinforce his blows.
For long moments, they fought fiercely, neither gaining nor losing ground. Then, finally, Arin saw an opening and struck hard, knocking Sabel's sword out of her hand.
She conceded defeat, impressed by Arin's skill and determination.
With his final test complete, Arin emerged victorious, having proven himself capable of applying magic practically while fighting. He had earned the respect and admiration of all who witnessed his triumph.
And so, Arin joined the Battlemage ranks under Sabel's leadership. A new uniform was given to him, as well as a merit badge designating him as one of the promising young battlemages in the kingdom.
As he walked away from the ceremony, Arin couldn't help but feel proud of himself. He knew that he still had much to learn, but he was confident that he would continue to grow and develop his skills under Sabel's guidance.
But there was barely any time to celebrate. Eryndor, or, 'the Dark Sorcerer', as the kingdom's folk had nicknamed him, was rallying his troops, the minions from the Black Guard, and a swarm of monsters he had summoned from another plane.
Arin would only have a single day to rest, before he had to depart towards the front lines for the first time, to defend his homeland against the impending threat of the Dark Sorcerer's wrath. And so, Arin set off to prepare for the battle ahead, determined to use his magic to protect those he cared about.
Chapter 6: Departure
Arin woke up early in the morning, feeling excited yet nervous about his first deployment.
In a sense, his whole reason for learning magic and joining Sabel had been the promise of bringing those who attacked his home to justice. To stop Eryndor Stoneheart and his followers.
Dad: "Goodbye, my son. Be brave and strong."
Mom: "We are proud of you, Arin. You are going to do great things."
With tears in his eyes, Arin hugged them both tightly and promised to keep in touch. His sister, who had been quietly sitting to the side, stood up and walked up to him, holding her bow.
Irina: "Big brother! Take me with you! You said you'd think about it! And, my skill with the bow is very good! I'll be useful, I promise!"
