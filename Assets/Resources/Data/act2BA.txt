Arin hesitated for a moment, then sighed, knowing that she wouldn't stop pestering him until he agreed.
Arin: "Okay, okay. You can come with me. But, remember, we're going to war. It won't be easy."
Irina: "I know! I'm ready for anything! Let's go save our kingdom!"
Together, they left their house and headed towards the stables where Sabel was waiting for them.
Sabel: "What? Arin, why are you bringing your sister along?"
Arin: "She wants to come with us. She says she's ready for anything."
Sabel: "Well, if she's willing to risk her life alongside us, then she's welcome to join us on this mission. We could use another archer."
There were around twenty soldiers from the kingdom's army accompanying them. Sabel had been designated the general of the operation, so they would follow her orders.
Arin was treated as her second in command, and while they did not seem to respect Irina much, they tolerated her despite being a young girl with only the bare minimum amount of training.
As for Eldric, he still had to prepare Ralz's defenses, and couldn't join them right away. He would catch up with them a few days later. They would need to wait for him before actually beginning the assault.
As they rode out of the city, Arin gave a fond, but concerned look at his sister, who cherfully hummed a song as she walked next to him. He knew that he would have to protect her, no matter what.
Sabel: "We're going to the stronghold Eryndor and the Black Guard have occupied. It's located at the village of Dune. We need to gather information before we attack."
Arin nodded, tightening his grip on his sword hilt.
They arrived at the village after several days of riding, and found it empty, except for a few frightened villagers who had hidden in their homes.
One old man came out of his house when he saw them approach.
Old Man: "Thank the gods you've come! The Black Guard has been terrorizing us for weeks now. Please, help us!"
Arin: "Don't worry, we'll get rid of those bastards once and for all. Where is the stronghold?"
The old man pointed towards the woods nearby.
Sabel: "Thank you. We'll take care of it. For now, let's station our troops here and get the lay of the land."
They set up camp outside the village, and Arin took first watch along with two other soldiers.
As he stood guard, he thought about his family, and how much he wanted to protect them.
The scouts returned after a while with concerning news.
The Black Guard's leader, Thal, had been seen commanding a giant as they stepped into a hidden fortress deeper into the forest.
Several imp-like demons accompanied them, and they seemed to be bringing prisoners inside. Other monsters of all kind had been sighted patroling the woods around the fortress, as well.
Sabel: "So the rumors are true. The Dark Sorcerer commands monsters, as well as the Dark Guard. This is going to be difficult."
Arin: "We can do this. Let's plan an attack."
Sabel nodded, and together they brainstormed a strategy, slowly perfecting it over the course of two days.
When Eldric finally arrived to Dune village, it was decided that the attack on the fortress would happen that very evening.
They decided that Arin would lead a small group of soldiers to infiltrate the fortress through a secret entrance known only to the locals.
Meanwhile, Sabel, Eldric and the rest of the army would surround the fortress and engage the monsters from the outside.
As they prepared for the assault, Arin couldn't help but feel nervous. He was still new to battle magic, and he didn't want to screw up.
Irina: "I'm coming with you, big brother. I'll back you up as we infiltrate the castle!"
Arin smiled at her determination. It meant a lot to have his sister by his side during such a dangerous mission. Looking at her earnest expression, he felt his nerves slowly dissolve, as a newfound confidence grew within him.
Chapter 7: Infiltrating the Stronghold
That same night, Arin, Irina and five soldiers set out towards the fortress, moving quietly through the trees.
The group had to stop and hide once they noticed nearby monsters patrolling the area.They were a bunch of red, small demons, holding pikes and tridents.
The demons stood in-between them and the secret entrance! Arin's group waited for the others at Dune village to cause a commotion.
Sabel and Eldric, commanding the kingdom's soldiers, charged forward from the village, into the midst of the chaos. Swords clashed and magical lighning fell, provoking the enemy.
After quietly approaching the group of enemies standing in their way from the shadows, Arin used his magic to create a diversion, a floating ball of light.
It drew the attention of the red demons, which had stuck around to guard the fortress, blinding them. The soldiers took advantage of this distraction to sneak past them unnoticed.
Inside the fortress walls, things were quieter than outside. Most of the enemy's warriors had gone out to engage Eldric and Sabe, leaving the fortress rather undermanned.
Knights wearing black armor stood, vigilant, next to the staircase leading to the higher floors of the fortress.
Unlike the dumb demons they fooled earlier, these knights would be much harder to elude.
Right as Arin was going to command the group to reveal themselves and attack, Irina pulled on his sleeve.
Irina: "Arin, can you hear that? It's coming from over there."
She gestured towards a door to the side. Steps descended, and Arin imagined it'd lead to the basement of the fortress. Perhaps, to the dungeon?
Paying closer attention to the sounds, he could barely hear moans and shouts, angry and terrified.
Arin: "That must be where they took the captives. We need to rescue them!"
One of the members of his group didn't seem so sure.
Soldier: "I don't know about that, sir Arin. I'm sorry for the prisoners, but that's not what we're here for. Our mission is to take out Thal and Eryndor. I doubt we will find them down there."
Irina: "What do you suggest we do then?"
The soldier hesitated before answering.
Soldier: "We should probably stick to our plan. Find the Dark Sorcerer, and then worry about the captives."
But Arin couldn't shake off the feeling that something terrible was happening behind those doors. He knew he couldn't just leave the captives to suffer.
Arin: "We're saving the captives first. Everyone, follow me."
He led the charge through the door, into a dimly lit corridor. A few red demons stood between them and the prisoners, but they quickly dealt with them using their weapons and magic.
Once inside the cell, Arin saw that the captives were not just humans, but also other creatures like elves and dwarves. They all looked terribly afraid, and some even had injuries from being tortured.
Arin: "It's okay, everyone. We're going to get you out of here."
Prisoner: "Thank goodness you're here! They were planning to use us as sacrifices to summon more demons into our realm!"
Irina looked sick.
Irina: "So all those red demons we've seen so far were...?"
Prisoner: "Yes... to summon each one of those, they took a life from us."
Arin: "And there were so many, too... This is unforgivable!"
As he helped free the captives, Arin seethed, knowing that the sorcerer who did this needed to be stopped. But for now, he focused on getting everyone safely outside the castle walls.
Arriving to the entrance they used to sneak into the fortress, Arin stopped and turned to the five soldiers accompanying him.
Arin: "I'm going back in there. You take these people back to safety."
Soldier: "Sir Arin, you can't possibly hope to fight Eryndor on your own and win! He has an army of demons and monsters on his side!"
Arin: "I know. But I have to try. If I don't, then everything we've fought for means nothing. So please, go ahead without me. I'll catch up with you later."
Without waiting for any further argument, Arin marched back towards the castle gates, determined to put an end to the sorcerer's reign of terror once and for all.
Irina quietly walked after him. He knew there was no way to get her to stay behind, not when she had just witnessed firsthand what kind of horrors Eryndor was capable of unleashing upon the world.
She would be by his side until the very end, no matter what.
Chapter 8: The final battle
The two of them charged through the castle doors, weapons at the ready.
The interior was dark and eerie, with flickering torches casting shadows everywhere.
They could hear the sounds of demonic laughter echoing throughout the halls, as well as the clanging of metal and the screams of the wounded.
As they made their way deeper into the fortress, Arin and Irina encountered a group of demon guards.
With a fierce cry, Arin charged forward, his sword flashing as he imbued his magic into it.
Irina: "You're not going to lay a finger on my big brother, you demons!"
Demon: "Take down the girl first!"
The demons changed their targets from Arin to Irina, firing their flaming projectiles at her. She closed her eyes and flinched, seeing the fireballs fly at her, faster than she could react.
But then, a shield made of light surrounded her, blocking the fireballs the demons threw at her.
Arin: "I'm not letting any of you touch my sister either!"
Irina: "Thanks, Arin! I don't think I can beat these guys alone."
Together, they fought their way through the fortress, encountering more and more demons along the way.
But with their combined efforts, they were able to defeat all of them, until finally, they reached the heart of the fortress.
Suddenly, they heard a wicked voice booming from somewhere ahead.
Eryndor: "Come out and face me, boy! I have something special planned for you."
Without hesitation, Arin and Irina rushed towards the source of the sound. It led them to a large chamber where Eryndor awaited them.
The sorcerer stood tall and imposing, surrounded by an aura of dark energy that seemed to pulse and swirl around him.
In one hand, he held a glowing crystal orb that pulsed with an eerie blue light.
Arin knew what this was about. He had seen a similar orb before, described and drawn in the pages of the book that Sabel made him read on the day she accepted him as an apprentice.
It was an Arcane Focus, an artifact used by powerful mages to channel their magical energies into devastating spells.
Arin: "You won't get away with this, Eryndor! We're going to stop you!"
Eryndor: "Hahaha. On the contrary boy. I've already gotten away with it. My plan is finally complete."
As soon as he spoke, Eryndor launched a barrage of bolts of concentrated, magical darkness at Arin, which he dodged nimbly.
Then, Arin unleashed a blinding flash of light that struck the sorcerer squarely in the chest.
Eryndor seemed to stumble backwards, but he recovered his balance and grinned at Arin.
Eryndor: "Well done, boy. You've proven yourself powerful and talented, and therefore, worthy of my interest. All that power will be mine soon enough, once I've taken control of you."
The Dark sorcerer snapped his fingers and a black cloud of corrupted magic emerged from the ground, right below his feet.
Irina: "Arin! Watch out!"
Before he could react, Irina had pushed him with her hands, causing him to fall on his back, outside of the evil cloud of magic, which had now enveloped his sister.
Irina: "Gyaaahhh!"
Arin: "Irina! Irina!"
He tried to reach her, but the dark force was too strong, keeping him at bay. He saw her struggling within the cloud, her face contorted with fear and agony.
Eryndor: "Tsk. Such a waste. I have no use for a magic-less pawn."
Eryndor: "Though, perhaps... Yes, this will do nicely."
Without warning, the sorcerer sent a bolt of dark energy towards Irina, who screamed in terror as she was engulfed by the malevolent force.
Arin: "No! Irina!"
He charged forward, determined to save his sister, but the sorcerer was too quick, sending another bolt of darkness after him.
Arin was forced to shield himself with his barrier of light in order to endure the Dark Sorcerer's spell. When he dismissed it, what he saw left him frozen, in shock.
Irina's body had begun to transform.
Leathery wings emerged from her back, horns grew on her head, and her eyes began to shine. A slender, spaded tail grew from her back, wagging in the air as she clutched her head, and whimpered.
Arin: "Irina!"
Irina: "B-big brother... stay away...! I can't control... my body...!"
Eryndor: "Behold, foolish boy. Your beloved sister is now a Greater Demoness. And like the rest of the demons in this place, she will obey me, as long as I have this Arcane Focus!"
Eryndor: "Now... Servant Irina! I command you to drain the boy's essence. Claim his power for yourself, and turn him into an empty husk!"
Irina: "N-no... Big Brother... please don't let him take me..."
Arin knew that he could not defeat the powerful sorcerer alone. He needed help. He looked around frantically, searching for someone, anyone who could assist him.
At that moment, Sabel broke into the room, followed by Eldric who stood next to her, watching in horror as Irina's transformation completed.
Sabel: "Arin! What happened here? Why is Irina like... that?"
Eldric: "Corrupt Soul. A spell that warps a mortal's soul and turns them into a Monster... or a demon."
The Dark Sorcerer sneered at the two newcomers.
Eryndor: "So you made it all the way here, huh. Then Thal and his goons were defeated in the end. So much for the Black Guard. Useless dogs, the lot of them!"
Eryndor: "Doesn't matter. I don't need them anymore. Irina, you will also claim their essence and end their lives. Devour them and grow, or starve and perish! I don't need any other magic users in my world."
Right as the Dark Sorcerer said that, Irina's belly growled loudly, as she was assaulted by a perverse hunger.
It clouded her thoughts. She needed to feed, to drain the magic of her master's enemies. She could not defy him.
Sabel: "We have to save her! Arin, what can we do?"
Arin: "There must be a way to break the curse. We just need to find it."
He turned to Eldric, hoping that he might know something about the Corrupt Soul spell. But the old mage only shook his head sadly.
Eldric: "She has already become a demon. There is no known cure, no way to return her to normal anymore. Her humanity has been lost. And sooner or rather, her demonic nature will warp her personality. We need to put her down, Arin. While she is still herself. That's the only way to free her now."
Arin: "No... no!"
Irina: ".................."
Arin: "Irina..."
Irina: "...Master. What are your orders?"
Eryndor: "Kill them. All of them. Make sure they suffer before they die. And then, come back to me. You will be rewarded, my dear."
Irina nodded, her eyes glowing red with anticipation. Her hands transformed into claws, and she charged towards Arin and the other two mages.
Sabel's sword clashed against Irina's claws, keeping her at bay.
Eldric protected the battlemage with his own spells, while casting lightning bolts and fireballs at the demon Irina had become.
But she shrugged off the spells, entirely unaffected by them.
Eryndor: "Hahaha! It's useless! It takes more than two or three mages of your level to defeat a Greater Demoness. Your worthless spells can't save now!"
Arin watched in shock, while Eryndor laughed.
At that point, the young mage remembered something Eryndor had said. He mumbled to himself, in a low voice.
Arin: "Like the rest of the demons in this place..."
Eryndor: "Hmmm? What was that, boy? Did you finally lose your mind?"
Arin: "...She has no choice but to obey you... as long as you have that... Arcane Focus of yours."
Eryndor's eyes narrowed.
Eryndor: "What do you mean, boy?"
Arin: "You told us how you used it to control the demons here. If we take it away from you... maybe we can break the spell on Irina too."
Eryndor: "That's quite a gamble you're taking, boy. Is that girl worth that much to you?"
Arin: "Yes, she is! Irina is everything for me!"
The demoness, which had been slowly pushing Sabel and Eldric into a corner, stopped on her tracks, trembling, when she heard Arin's heartfelt shout. She took a deep breath, whimpering pitifully, her movements becoming clumsier.
Irina: "Big brother..."
Perhaps it was hesitation, or perhaps Irina was resisting as best as she could the demonic influence that forced her to fight against her allies.
One way or another, it gave Sabel the chance she needed to put some needed distance between herself and Irina, and catch her breath.
Eldric wiped the sweat off his forehead and quickly drank a mana potion, replenishing his magic reserves.
Enraged, Irina kept slashing at them, while the brief spark of her old self, which was holding her back, flickered weakly.
Irina: "Grr... Ghhh....Raaahhh!"
Arin yelled and charged towards Eryndor, who was caught off guard by the sudden attack.
Extending one arm, he cast a spell and began floating in the air, getting out of Arin's range.
The young mage pulled out the bow his father had given him and aimed at the sorcerer, charging his arrow with light, with his very own brand of magic.
The arrow striked true, landing on Eryndor, who screamed in pain, dropping the Arcane Focus to the floor as he levitated higher, closer to the ceiling.
The Dark Sorcerer's magic had been disrupted, and all of his spells were failing, one after another.
Eryndor:  "This... can't be... happening!"
Arin managed to grab hold of the Arcane Focus, catching it in his arms before it landed to the ground. He held onto it tightly, pumping his own magic into the orb.
Arin: "Irina! Stop attacking Sabel and Eldric! You no longer have to do that! I cancel Eryndor's orders!"
He didn't know if it would be enough, but he knew he couldn't let his friends keep fighting each other like this.
Irina: "Okay... Big Brother."
She took a step back, spreading her wings and flying away from Sabel and Eldric.
Her belly still growled. If she did not feed on a mortal's essence soon, she would decay and perish.
In order to extend her life, she needed to consume a mage. Ideally, a powerful one.
And as she flew, she happened to see one in the air, not too far away from her.
Her eyes sparkled, still bright and red, and an all too unnervingly innocent smile appeared in her youthful lips.
Irina: "Thanks for the meal~"
Eryndor: "S-stop! You can't do this to me!"
She giggled, flying at a high speed towards Eryndor, who tried to flee desperately.
As Arin watched, Eryndor was knocked off balance by the sudden appearance of Irina, who had flown up behind him.
The sorcerer tried to defend himself with a spell, but it was too late.
Irina sank her teeth into his neck, and injected her sharp, spaded tail into his flesh, draining his power and life force until he collapsed in a heap on the ground.
His old body turned to dust and crumbled away as soon as he landed.
Irina stretched, feeling new power course through her body. She licked her lips, having awakened to the absolutely delicious taste of magic.
With the Dark Sorcerer's power running through her, she could feel herself growing stronger, smarter... even more attractive! All of her features were evolving, becoming more refined.
As if experiencing a bliss without equal, she fell to her knees, in a daze, a dumb smile spreading over her face.
Arin ran up to her, hugging her.
Arin: "Irina! Are you okay? Are you..."
He paused, looking at her. She had changed so much, but in her eyes, she was still the same little sister he adored so much.
Arin: "Is it still you in there, Irina...?"
She opened her eyes, as if snapping out of her revelry.
Irina: "A-ah! Big brother! Y-you mustn't hold me this close! I-I'm a demon now, you know? I'll feel tempted to eat you too...!"
She looked down in shame. What had awakened from her blissul state hadn't been his brother's voice, but the delicious, pure magic flowing inside him. Taking a bite of him too would be... so easy...
She smacked herself, slapping her own cheeks, to push those thoughts away.
Eldric and Arin looked at the two brothers from afar, worried.
Irina: "Big bro, listen... I know you won't like it, but... As long as you have that... orb thingy, I can't oppose you. So now that I'm unable to do anything to you... you should..."
She bit her lip, looking at her older brother's face, always so confident and reliable, scrunched and full of tears.
Irina: "Arin, please... M-mister Eldric was right. Sooner or later, I'll become wicked. I can already feel myself growing more and more...awful, every second that passes."
Irina: "You have to stop me. T-that's why you started this journey, isn't it? So that what happened to our village doesn't happen again?"
Irina: "If you let me live, someday I'll end up causing things like that... or worse. And we don't want that... do we?"
Her words were shaky, but she managed to keep eye contact with them both until the very end.
Arin: "Irina... You can't ask me to kill you. I can't... You know I can't!"
Eldric: "Arin. Listen to me. You don't have to kill her. The Dark Sorcerer's Arcane Focus can banish her from our plane."
Eldric: "All the demons Eryndor summoned, you can send them back to the plane they came from. Where they won't be able to do harm to mortals anymore."
Eldric: "Send them back. And let her go with them. That way she'll live... even if it means, you won't ever see her again."
Sabel walked up to Arin from behind and hugged him, tightly.
Sabel: "...It's your choice, Arin. No matter what you pick... I will support you. That's the least I can do, for my dear apprentice, isn't it?"
Arin: "Thank you, Sabel. It really means a lot to me."
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
