Chapter 9: The new Dark Sorcerer.
Arin: "I can't just let her go. She's my sister. I can't..."
He trailed off, looking at Irina with a mix of emotions. He knew he couldn't simply abandon her, not after everything they had been through together. Not after all the memories they shared.
Arin: "Eldric, tell me. Why did the kingdom declare Eryndor a 'Dark Sorcerer'?"
Eldric: "Because he resorted to forbidden magic. He summoned demons. And fed them mortals. He plotted to use them to overthrow the king, and claim the kingdom, no, the whole world for himself."
Arin: "A Dark Sorcerer is one who keeps demons around, and feeds them, is it?"
Eldric gasped, realizing what Arin was contemplating. Sabel stayed quiet, closing her eyes. She had seen this coming.
Irina: "B-big brother? What are you..."
Arin: "Irina. As long as you're bound to me, by this Arcane Focus, I can keep you from attacking innocent people, right?"
The former human, now demoness nods, reluctant. "Y-yeah... I'd be compelled to leave them alone. If you commanded such a thing."
Arin nodded to himself, his decision made.
Arin: "From now on... I will be the new Dark Sorcerer. All so that I can keep you with me. With us."
Irina started crying, nuzzling her face against Arin's chest.
Sabel: "It will make you an enemy of the kingdom, you know? The King will never allow a mage who summons demons to exist, and threaten his kingdom again."
Eldric gulped, nodding.
Eldric: "Arin, are you absolutely certain about this?"
Arin nods, solemnly.
Arin: "I am. I'll keep her in this plane, close to me. And... find a way to feed her, if I need to. I'll do this for as long as it takes to bring her back to normal. And if there is no way to restore Irina's humanity with magic... I'll keep looking and looking until I find a way. Even if I have to create it myself."
Sabel: "And if you create the cure to Soul Corruption? What will you do then?"
Arin looked at Irina and gently caressed her head, like he had done so many times in the past.
Arin: "Once Irina is back to normal, I'll shatter this cursed Arcane Focus, and the Dark Sorcerer will cease to be."
He turned to look at Sabel, his eyes full of determination.
Arin: "But until then, we must continue training, learning, and preparing ourselves for whatever may come our way. Because when the time comes, we cannot fail."
With that, Arin took Irina by the hand, wiped her tears gently and left together with her, leaving behind the ruins of the once beautiful town, now tainted by the evil that lurked within its walls.
As they walked away, Sabel couldn't help but wonder what kind of future awaited them all. But one thing was clear - they would face it together, and nothing could stop them from achieving their goal. Not even the wrath of the Kingdom itself.
The end.
